This is an example of visitor pattern.

Visitor's primary purpose is to abstract functionality that can be applied to an
aggregate hierarchy of "element" objects. The hierarchy in this example is 
'Customer->Order'. 'GeneralReport' class is the one which will go through all hierarchy 
and print element details.

The accept() method causes flow of control to find the correct Element subclass. Then
when the visit() method is invoked, flow of control is vectored to the correct Visitor
subclass.

Customer can have multiple orders and order can have multiple items in it. We need to
display all the details by visiting all the nodes in hierarchy. You need to complete
method calls appropriately which would implement visitor design pattern. After completing 
all the blanks, the expected output will be as follows:

Customer Customer1
Order Order1
Order Order2
Customer Customer2
Order Order3
Number of customers:2
Number of orders:   3

Note: You need to implement mediator pattern for this example, not pertaining answers will not
be expected as correct even if the output matched the expected output
