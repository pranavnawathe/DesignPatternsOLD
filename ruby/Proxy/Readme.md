This is an example of proxy design pattern, where we can access one of the object (subject) though an object of another class (proxy)

Here, the proxy object is 'MoviePlayer' which controls the access to movie object from client (main method)


Fill in the blanks such a way that the finished code would implement Proxy design pattern


When completed, the output should be as following:
Name: The Prestige
 Size: 1023MB
 Director: Christopher Nolan

Playing movie: The Prestige


Assume that movie object is not accessible in main method.
